University of Washington
Research Scientist
May 2013 – Jun 2013 | Seattle, WA
  ∙ Developed software to repurpose FDA approved compounds through
    combining atomic level knowledge of compound-protein interactions
    with compound-disease associations which was able to identify a
    known use for a compound for over one in four FDA approved drugs
    which passed an initial screening against the human genome.


University of Washington
Research Fellow
Jun 2011 – Sep 2012 | Seattle, WA
  ∙ Created method to simulate single nucleotide polymorphisms whose ROC curve
    was substantially above the identity function through Gaussian anomaly
    detection to identify mutations which effected gene function.
  ∙Full enrollment in graduate courses in Applied Mathematics in addition to
   full time work writing and rigorously benchmarking software for
   macromolecular docking and protein design.
